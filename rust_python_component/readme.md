# Basic Calculator Using Rust WebAssembly Component with Python Bindings

This project demonstrates how to create a simple calculator as a WebAssembly component in Rust, then call it from Python using `wasmtime-py` with bindings generated by `componentize-py`. The Rust component performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication), and the Python code interacts with this compiled WebAssembly binary.

1. Create the Rust component with corresponding .wit and .rs lib
```
cargo component new rust_comp --lib
cargo component build --release
```

2. After the Wasm component created we convert it into Python bindings to be able to call it from Python host app.

```
python -m wasmtime.bindgen path/to/rust_comp.wasm --out-dir rust_comp
```

3. Call the rust_comp Wasm exports from Python to create an application that calls Wasm binary created with Rust using `wasmtime-py`. 

**Note:** `wasmtime-py` can not create bindings of Wasm binaries if there is dependency on *resources* and neither can call them. It means that a component created by `componentize-py` can not be used with `wasmtime-py` to call another python based wasm component since `componentize-py` unconditionally imports most of the `wasi:cli` world.
